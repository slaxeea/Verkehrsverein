# Verkehrsverein

Short project for school                           

We were given a list of events which we should display and sort by different criteria.                       

I chose to to it with HTML and JavaScript to improve my skills in those areas.              

Features:
- to add new events simply edit the .json file
- change betwwen four languages (de, en, fr, fin) or add your own by creating a new language file!
- change between three different themes for the page, light mode, dark mode or maybe an experimental lime?
- sort by five different criteria
- counts the number of results for your query (don't laugh, this took me embarassingly long)
- add new events by visiting the new-event.html page
  (the new events are deleted if you use another browser tho)


enjoy  :)
